## 🧠 How the ML Works

```
User skills input
       ↓
TF-IDF Vectorization  →  converts text to numeric vectors
       ↓
Cosine Similarity     →  compares user vector vs all job vectors
       ↓
Ranked Results        →  top matches shown with % score
```

- **TF-IDF** gives higher weight to important/rare words in job descriptions
- **Cosine Similarity** measures the angle between two vectors (0% to 100% match)
- **Content-Based Filtering** — recommendations based on job content, not user history
- Model trains **once** and saves as `.pkl` — instant load on every restart after that

## 🚀 Setup & Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or above
- pip

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/job-recommendation-system.git
cd job-recommendation-system

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate it
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Setup database (downloads real dataset automatically)
python database/setup_db.py

# 6. Train the ML model
python model/recommender.py

# 7. Run the app
python app.py
```

Open browser → **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

> ⚠️ First run takes ~10 seconds to download the dataset and train the model. Every run after that is instant.
